# Genetic Algorithm Solver in C++

## Overview
This repository contains a C++ implementation of a Genetic Algorithm (GA) designed to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). Genetic Algorithms are optimization techniques inspired by the process of natural selection, making them suitable for solving complex problems where traditional methods may struggle.

## Features
- **Genetic Algorithm Implementation**: A complete GA framework including selection, crossover, mutation, and fitness evaluation.
- **Customizable Parameters**: Easily adjust population size, mutation rate, crossover rate, and number of generations to optimize performance.
- **Performance Metrics**: Tracks and displays the best solution found, average fitness, and convergence trends over generations.
- **Command-Line Interface**: Simple command-line interface for running experiments and visualizing results.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- C++11 or later
- A C++ compiler (e.g., g++, clang++)
- CMake (optional, for building)

### Installation
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/manirazii/genetic.git
   cd genetic-algorithm-cpp
