# Genetic Algorithm Solver

## Overview
This repository contains a C++ implementation of a Genetic Algorithm (GA) designed to solve various optimization problems, including but not limited to the Knapsack Problem and the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). Genetic Algorithms are inspired by the process of natural selection and are effective for finding approximate solutions to complex problems.

## Features
- **Flexible Implementation**: Easily adaptable to different optimization problems.
- **Customizable Parameters**: Adjust population size, mutation rate, crossover rate, and number of generations to optimize performance.
- **Performance Metrics**: Tracks and displays the best solution found, average fitness, and convergence trends over generations.
- **Command-Line Interface**: Simple command-line interface for running experiments and visualizing results.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- C++11 or later
- A C++ compiler (e.g., g++, clang++)
- CMake (optional, for building)

### Installation
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/manirazii/Genetic
   cd genetic-algorithm-cpp
